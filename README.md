7Geese Backend Test
===================

Determine whether a number is a palindrome. If the number is not a palindrome,
then print out the closest palindrome(s).


##Run the program

There are no external packages involved, so you don't have to install anything
or create a virtual environment.

To run the program, just execute `python ./code_challenge.py -n 121`
where "121" is, of course, the number you are checking.

## Testing

To run the tests, do a `python ./test_code_challenge.py`.
I tested everything on Python2.7 on my Windows box (I know, I know...)
